Traditional payment methods often come with inconveniences and risks, while the adoption of digital cash faces various challenges. Rupify addresses these issues by providing users with a convenient, secure, and efficient way to manage and transact digital currency, even without a continuous internet connection.

## Key Features

### Aadhar Wallet Integration

Rupify integrates Aadhar Wallets with its backend infrastructure, creating secure digital wallets linked to usersâ€™ Aadhar information. This integration ensures a seamless user experience and enhances the security of transactions.

### Semi-Offline Payments

The concept of eRupee is extended to enable semi-offline payments, allowing users to transact securely even without a continuous internet connection. This feature ensures that users can make transactions anytime, anywhere, regardless of their connectivity status.

### Enhanced User Authentication

Rupify enhances user authentication and security by integrating OTP verification functionality in Django. This additional layer of security enhances the overall integrity of the platform and safeguards user accounts from unauthorized access.

### Robust Encryption

To ensure the highest level of data security, Rupify employs AES-256 Cipher for robust encryption of user information and transactions. This encryption mechanism protects sensitive data from unauthorized access and ensures the confidentiality of user information.

### Efficient Transaction Management

Rupify utilizes the Django framework to handle transactions and user wallet management efficiently. This ensures seamless operation and reliability, enabling users to manage their digital currency effortlessly.
